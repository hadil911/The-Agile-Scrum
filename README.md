## Welcome Hadi's first ever website. Its my first one so be kind.

I give most of the content credit to[Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum) and Also James Belchamber.

If you have come to learn about what Scrum is, why we use it and how it relates to Agile but is not the same thing... Then you've come to the right place.

### What is Scrum?

Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. Much like a rugby team (where it gets its name) training for the big game, Scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.

While the Scrum I’m talking about is most frequently used by software development teams, its principles and lessons can be applied to all kinds of teamwork. This is one of the reasons Scrum is so popular. Often thought of as an agile project management framework, Scrum describes a set of meetings, tools, and roles that work in concert to help teams structure and manage their work.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/hadil911/The-Agile-Scrum/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
