<h1>Welcome Hadi's first ever website. Its my first one so be kind.</h1>

<p> If you have come to learn about what <bold>Scrum</bold> is, <br>
 why we use it and how it relates to <bold>Agile</bold> but is not the same thing...<br>
  Then you've come to the right place.

 <h2>What is Scrum?</h2>

<p><bold>Scrum</bold> is a framework that helps teams work together. Much like a rugby team (where it gets its name)<br>
 training for the big game, <bold>Scrum</bold> encourages teams to learn through experiences, <br>
  self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.</p>

<p>While the <bold>Scrum</bold> I’m talking about is most frequently used by software development teams, <br>
its principles and lessons can be applied to all kinds of teamwork. This is one of the reasons <bold>Scrum</bold> is so popular.<br>
 Often thought of as an agile project management framework, <bold>Scrum</bold> describes a set of meetings, <br>
 tools, and roles that work in concert to help teams structure and manage their work.

<h3>What are sprints? Im makng some changes to this</h3>

<p>A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work.<br>
 Sprints are at the very heart of <bold>scrum</bold> and <bold>agile</bold> methodologies, and getting sprints right will help your <bold>agile</bold> <br>
  team ship better software with fewer headaches.  </p>

<p>“With Scrum, a product is built in a series of iterations called sprints that break down big, complex projects into bite-sized pieces," <br>
said Megan Cook, Group Product Manager for Jira Software at Atlassian.

    <h2>The difference between <bold>Scrum</bold> and <bold>Agile</bold>?</h2>
   <ul>
<li>Many people confuse <bold>Scrum</bold> and <bold>Agile</bold> as the same thing. They're not!</li>
<li><bold>Scrum</bold> is a framework for getting work done</li>
<li><bold>Agile</bold> is a set of values and principles</li>
<li>A framewok like <bold>Scrum</bold> is there to help you start thinking in a more <bold>Agile</bold> way and to help you practice building <bold>Agile</bold> principles.</li>
   </ul>
